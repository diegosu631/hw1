    <h1>Software Development</h1>
    <h2>Fall 2017</h2>
    <p>This course is geared to provide technical literacy for non-programmers who will be founders, employees, or consultants to "tech-enabled" organizations.  This is a survey-style course that is very hands-on – students will learn the essentials of coding by creating websites and basic software applications that manipulate data and work across today’s platforms and devices. It is important to be on time and to have reviewed all assigned supplemental materials.
